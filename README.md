# Bachelor's Thesis
**Enhancements for MACsec providing transparent Layer-2 encryption**

This repository contains all materials for my thesis.

The thesis itself is written in LaTeX, the source files are in the `thesis/` directory.

The implementation can be found in `macsec/`, the scripts for evaluation are in `evaluation/` and a small test environment can be setup with the files contained in `test/` and [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com).

Each directory contains its own README file.

* Modified macsec module: [Implementation](macsec/README.md)
* Evaluation scripts and measurements: [Evaluation](evaluation/README.md)
