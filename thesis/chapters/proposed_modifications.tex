\chapter{Proposed Solution}
\label{ch:proposal}
Fragmenting \glspl{SDU} solves the \gls{MACsec} \gls{MTU} problem and is superior compared to \gls{MPDU} fragmentation as discussed in the previous chapter.
Therefore, this chapter specifies the proposed modifications of \gls{MACsec} to realize transparent \gls{SDU} fragmentation and concatenation.
Afterwards, the implementation is described.

\subsection{Transmission Process}

The following transmission flow is displayed as flowchart in figure~\ref{fig:fragmentation-flowchart} for a better understandability.

When a frame has to be sent using \gls{MACsec} it must be checked at the beginning whether fragmentation has to be applied.
This is the case if the size of the \gls{SDU} exceeds the maximum payload size of \gls{MACsec} regarding the \gls{MTU} of the underneath layer.
If the standard \gls{MTU} of 1500 bytes is set, the maximum payload size is 1468 bytes.

The fragmentation process must happen before applying \gls{MACsec}.
Therefore, the \gls{SDU} must be split.
The first fragment must be sent with the \acrfull{MF} bit set.
It must be ensured that the second fragment is processed next by \gls{MACsec}.

If the size of the \gls{SDU} undercuts the maximum payload size of \gls{MACsec}, concatenation must be applied if enabled.
Therefore, the queue of \gls{MACsec} has to be checked for additional \glspl{SDU} that belong to the same \acrfull{SC}.
If it contains \glspl{SDU}, they are dequeued and appended to the payload until the maximum payload size is matched or exceeded.
Source and Destination addresses of these \glspl{SDU} are cut.
It must be considered that for each additional \gls{SDU} the maximum payload is decreased by two bytes because an extension header must be added.
The last \gls{SDU} may be fragmented if otherwise the maximum payload size is exceeded.
The lengths of the additional \glspl{SDU} are saved for the creation of the \gls{SecTAG}.

When creating the \gls{SecTAG} for each additional \gls{SDU} an extension header is appended to the \gls{SecTAG}.
The extension header contains the size of the corresponding \gls{SDU}.
The $n$th extension header corresponds to the $n+1$th \gls{SDU}.
The \acrlong{E} bit is set for all but the last extension headers.

After the fragmentation and concatenation process, \gls{MACsec} is applied as usual.

\subsection{Receiving Process}
The following receive flow is displayed as flowchart in figure~\ref{fig:receive-flowchart}.

When a frame is received it must be validated as specified by the original \gls{MACsec} standard.
Except to this validation is the check if both reserved bits of the \gls{SL} field are set as these are now the \gls{E} and \gls{MF} bit.

If the validation is successful, it is checked whether the \gls{E} bit is set.
If the \gls{E} bit is set, all extension headers are processed and the payload is cut into several \glspl{SDU}.
The length of each one is derived by the extension headers.
The Source- and Destination addresses are prepended to each \gls{SDU}.
If the \gls{E} bit is not set, the payload contains only one \gls{SDU}.

If the fragmentation buffer for the current \gls{SC} contains any data, the first \gls{SDU} must be prepended to this data and the whole, new \gls{SDU} must be delivered.
If the \gls{MF} bit is set, the last \gls{SDU} has to be saved into the buffer for the current \gls{SC}.

Finally, all remaining \glspl{SDU} are delivered.

  \label{fig:extension-header}
\end{figure}


The modified \gls{MPDU} is displayed in figure~\ref{fig:concat-sectag}.
The first unused bit after the \acrlong{SL} field is the \gls{MF} bit.
This bit indicates whether the payload is fragmented and the next frame contains the next fragment.
The second unused bit after the \acrlong{SL} field is the \gls{E} bit.
This bit indicates whether an extension header is appended to the \gls{SecTAG}.

The extension header comprises of an 11 bit long \acrfull{SEGL} field and an \gls{E} bit.
These are seperated by 4 unused bits.
The \gls{SEGL} field contains the length of the corresponding \gls{SDU}.
The $n$th extension header corresponds to the $n + 1$th \gls{SDU}.
If the \gls{E} bit of an extension header is set, another extension header follows.
Otherwise, the payload follows.
