# Thesis
This file contains the LaTeX files of my bachelor's thesis.
I used [komascript](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/koma-script) and took some parts of the [thesis template created by TUD-OS](https://github.com/TUD-OS/latex-template).

The figures are mostly SVGs and can be found in `figures/`, chapters are in the `chapters/` directory.

The main file is [thesis.tex](thesis.tex).
